# DataBlitz Rubric

Short presentations of data are becoming more common at professional conferences in all disciplines. These "lightning talks" or "data blitzes" are short and allow a limited number of slides to communicate a study's main point. At least twice during the semester, you will present in this format. You will use one slide (no videos) to present the major findings of an experimental report in 5 minutes. A rubric for the evaluation of these presentations is below.
