#### What is a Reading Guide?

The best ways to succeed in BI164:

- Come to class and engage with the lecture and activities
- Read the textbook and take notes
- Ask questions

This document will help guide your reading of the textbook, *Biological Science* by Freeman, et al., 7th Ed. (Thanks to Dr. Allison Barner for providing the model for these guides and for sharing guides for chapters 12 and 13.)

Because we do not cover all of the material in a given chapter in lecture, this guide points out the sections of the textbook that are relevant to each lecture topic. Navigate to this week's topic using the sidebar table of contents (click on the left of the doc to expand the menu)

The guide tells you:

- which terms to focus on while reading, 
- which figures, tables, or activities are most important for your understanding,
- what are some of the things you should be able to do after completing the reading, and
- which practice problems in the chapter are most relevant for BI164 

#### How should I use this Reading Guide?

> [!TIP]
> Look for notes from Dr. Angelini indented in this style.

Each week, you should read the assigned textbook sections and take notes. “Taking notes” means writing notes by hand, annotating the text with your own comments, or typing up a structured notes document. Importantly, copying and pasting text from the textbook into a notes document has been shown to have no benefit for your learning or exam scores! Similarly, simply highlighting the textbook has limited impact.

Remember, reading notes should be *in addition* to notes you take during class. 

##### Define the following vocabulary terms

Write out your own definitions of each vocab term and/or check definitions against the glossary at the back of the book. 

Vocab sections below will initially be collapsed. You will need to click on the triangle (▶︎) to expand them.

##### Closely review the following tables / figures

The figures and tables listed here are important and should not be overlooked. Don't forget to read the captions! Try redrawing figures in your notes and annotating them with notes and questions

##### At the end of this reading you should be able to

Take a few minutes to test yourself against these reading goals and practice problems!
##### Relevant practice problems

Practice problem answers are at the back of the book. If you cannot complete these goals or answer the practice questions, make a note about where you want to follow up by asking a question in lecture, coming to office hours, asking a peer, coming to LA hours, and/or reviewing your notes from class and from the reading.

Again, I do not plan to write exam questions based on these sections because we will dive deeper into these topics later in the course.
