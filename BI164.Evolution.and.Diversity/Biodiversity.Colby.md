This activity allows members of the [Colby College](https://www.colby.edu/) community to explore and share local biodiversity. 

For students in Dr. Angelini's Spring 2025 [BI164B](https://github.com/aphanotus/openEd/tree/main/BI164.Evolution.and.Diversity#bi164-evolution--diversity), this project has a required component, but is also an opportunity to earn extra credit.



## How to get involved?

1. **Create an account with [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)**. It's free and your participation as a community scientist will benefit ecological and biodiversity research! Download the app to your smart device or create an account at https://www.inaturalist.org/ 
2. **Join [Biodiversity Colby](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-colby)**. Search for the project "Biodiversity Colby" or follow this link to our [iNaturalist project page](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-colby). Then just click the "Join" button in the upper right.
3. **Upload pictures of living things**. Use your cell phone's camera or any other digital camera. You can upload "Observations" from within the iNaturalist app, either in real time or from your photo reel. Digital camera photos can be transferred to a computer and uploaded on the iNaturalist website. Once you've joined the Project, all your qualifying observations will automatically be added to [Biodiversity Colby](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-colby).

All members of the Colby College Community are welcome to participate!



## BI164 BioBlitz

An important goal of *[BI164 Evolution and Diversity](https://github.com/aphanotus/openEd/tree/main/BI164.Evolution.and.Diversity#bi164-evolution--diversity)* is to appreciate the amazing range of living things. Towards that end, involvement will compose 10 points towards your class participation score.

### Rules

- Remember, this is meant to be fun! (and educational)
- Observations must be submitted to iNaturalist between March 15 and May 11, 2025.
- Students must submit their own observations 
- Students must provide a reasonable identification of each organism at the time it is submitted. However, the observation will count towards the taxon that the iNaturalist community ultimately identifies it as.
- To count towards an award, organisms must be in their natural environment. (Greenhouses, zoos, aquariums, natural history collections, etc. don't count.) 
- Humans and pets cannot be submitted as observations
- New bonus awards may be added at any time!
- Runners-up will receive half the award value, rounded down, unless there is a tie.
- In the event of a tie, winners will split the point value, rounded up.
- The total for bonus points from this project will be capped at 20 points for each student.
- Dr. Angelini has ultimate discretion to determine all outcomes of this competition, including judgements of "cuteness" and "danger".



### Tips

- This activity is meant to be fun and friendly. So please cheer on your classmates!
- You don't need to venture far away! Plenty of organisms live right beside us if you just look around, and slow down enough to be observant. 
- It's always a good idea to go in a group when [venturing into natural areas](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/ohio/stories-in-ohio/top-10-tips-for-outdoor-safety/). If you are unfamiliar with outdoor activities please seek the advice of more experienced people.
- If you collect organisms that are microscopic, talk with Dr. Angelini or your lab instructor about using a microscope to take pictures. Please realize that this might not always be possible due to timing or logistical constraints.
- The list of taxa above is really long! It's not expected that you should make observations of every one! This activity is not meant to take up all of your time!
