# DataBlitz Rubric

Short presentations of data are becoming more common at professional conferences in all disciplines. These "lightning talks" or "data blitzes" are short and allow a limited number of slides to communicate a study's main point. At least twice during the semester, you will present in this format. You will use one slide (no videos) to present the major findings of an experimental report in 5 minutes. A rubric for the evaluation of these presentations is below.

## Criteria

Since we have adopted an *ungrading* approach to this course, DataBlitzes will contribute to our conversations about effective development of course goals, particularly *3. practice reading and presenting in the context of morphometric analyses*. As you prepare your presentations and later reflect on your performance, keep the following criteria in mind. 

- Explain the studyâ€™s main purpose
- Explain necessary background
- Explain the rationale for methods
- Communicate results clearly in a single slide
- Explain the interpretation of results
- Explain significance of conclusions
- Include appropriate critiques or criticisms
- Present in an organized way
- Present in 5 minutes, on the scheduled date
