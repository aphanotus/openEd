# Rstudio tips and tricks

# Auto completion for functions
hea

# Auto completion for arguments
landmark.plot(plethodon, spe)

# Auto wrapping of quotes, parentheses, and `backticks`
landmark.plot(plethodon, text.color = blue)

# Comand-C to copy selection
# Comand-X to cut (copy and delete) selection
# Command-V to paste selection
# Command-Z to undo an edit

# Shift-Command-C to comment a line
# rm(list=ls())

# Command-D to delete a line

# Shift-Command-D to duplicate a line -- or duplicate a selection within or across lines

# In Rstudio don't use Shift-Command-S for "Save-As"!
# Rstudio default is that Shift-Command-S is "Source"
# which runs all code in the active document

# Instead "Save-As" is Option-Command-S


# Happy coding!
