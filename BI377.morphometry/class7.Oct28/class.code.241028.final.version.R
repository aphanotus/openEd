# We use the `anova` function to generate an ANOVA table.

# the `summary` function can generate the same output.
summary(size.model)

# How to interpret the results of each line in the table:
# - `Df` is the degrees of freedom.
# - `Rsq` (R^2) is the proportion of overall variance attributed to that factor.
#   The R^2 value for all factors (plus the residuals) will sum to 1.
# - `F` is the test F statistic.
# - `Z` is the "effect size". Unlike F or p, the Z-scores are comparable
#   across groups and data sets.
# - Pr(>F) is effectively the p-value

# **Notes on effect size**
# For univariate ANOVA, there are various measures of effect size.
# R^2 is typically one that is used since it can be interpreted as
# "the amount of variance accounted by each factor" -- or left
# unaccounted for by the model and instead appearing in the residuals.
# However, it has been argued (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWrbYxkCWYY&t=2942s)
# that this interpretation doesn't extend to multivariate analysis.
# Instead `Z` can be considered a better metric of effect size.
# It is a standardized value, calculated from the F statistic and its dispersion.
# Larger values of `Z` indicate a stronger effect for one factor, compared to another.
# Amazingly, Z-scores are comparable across groups and data sets.

# A model with 3 factors: size, population, and sex
# Since the simpler models suggest that `pop` has a larger effect size
# it makes sense (given Type I sums of squares) that it goes before `sex`.

# Examine the interaction between sex and population
# Biologically speaking, this model is testing whether the way that
# shape differs by sex might be different in each population.

# We can combine any number of terms in a model
# Although we should be cautious, since highly complex models are
# prone to "over-fitting" where the model seems to predict the data
# well, but this is only an artifact.

# How do you interpret the results?

# `pairwise` requires a null model, and it will guess if you donâ€™t specify one!
# You can check it's assumptions using `reveal.model.designs`, but it is
# good practice to explicitly define the null model.

reveal.model.designs(bees.sp.model)

# **Closing notes**
# - Modeling allows you to account for confounding factors, before examining a factor-of-interest
# - Interaction terms can be examined too, as `A * B` or `A + B + A:B`
# - The sequential order of factors in the model matters (this is Type I ANOVA)
