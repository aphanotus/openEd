# Recall how we did this for univariate data.

# using the Palmer pengiuns data








# Let's look at how we can make pairwise comparisons
# for models of shape data

# Check the sample sizes by species

# Create a `procD.lm` model of worker wing shape by size and species





# Then create a null model

# `pairwise` requires a null model, and it will guess if you donâ€™t specify one!
# You can check it's assumptions using `reveal.model.designs`, but it is
# good practice to explicitly define the null model.
