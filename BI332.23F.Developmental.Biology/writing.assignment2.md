# BI332 Writing Assignment 2

Writing assignments this semester will build towards the production of an experimental proposal of your own design in the style of an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GFRP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) proposal. Our second writing assignment will encourage you to explore the literature and take notes as you develop ideas on a topic. 

## Instructions

As introduced in class on October 4, your goal is to produce an annotated bibliography. 

First, decide on a topic relevant to developmental biology. You can look for ideas from the course schedule, or the table of contents in your textbook. You may want to refine your topic after you do some searching. Think about background information a reader (or you!) may need to know to explore this topic. Decide on some search terms for use with a literature database, such as [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [Scopus](https://colby.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.scopus.com/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). Evaluate the results by reading titles. If they seem too broad or too narrowly focused, adjust your search terms accordingly and run a new search. For promising titles, read the abstracts and apply a similar, iterative evaluation & search process. When you find articles that appear useful copy and paste their citation information and make some notes for yourself explaining how you might use that source to support a larger writing project. 

Your submission for the assignment must have 

- your name

- A short sentence stating the question, issue, or phenomenon you were interested in exploring

- citations to at least 8 articles (from peer-reviewed journals indexed by [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov))

- citations should be in the form of a biological journal -- There's lot of variation in those formats and I will not be dogmatic about style. However, it should contain the authors' surnames and initials int he correct order, year of publication, journal name, volume and pages numbers (if the journal uses those), and ideally a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) or [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (internet address). For example, you could use the format of the journal *[Development](https://dev.biologists.org/content/manuscript-prep#3.3.)*.

  **Lee, J.R., and Kuo, D.H.** (2020). Netrin expressed by the ventral ectoderm lineage guides mesoderm migration in epibolic gastrulation of the leech. *Developmental Biology*. **463**, 39-52. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.04.002

- a brief explanatory note (1-3 sentences or short statements) for each article that could be used to remind yourself how this article could be used in writing a full-length paper

This is an exercise to familiarize yourself with this method of literature research. It is not meant to be the final bibliography of your final paper. In fact, you are welcome to change topics completely for future writing assignments. However, the articles you find may be used as sources in later projects.

Please complete this assignment individually. You are welcome to discuss it with others. 

This assignment is worth 50 points toward the final course grade. 

Please submit your assignment on Moodle in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [PDF](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html), or [docx](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/) format by Tuesday, October 10 at 10:00pm.
