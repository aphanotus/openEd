# BI332 Writing Assignment 4

Writing assignments this semester will build towards the production of an experimental proposal of your own design in the style of an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) proposal. Our fourth writing assignment asks you to think carefully about an experimental plan.

## Instructions

Your submission for this assignment must include 

- Your name. 
- A [working title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) or short sentence stating the question, issue, or phenomenon you are interested in exploring
- A description of your experimental plans. 

Remember the aspects of a good experiment: hypotheses, experiments that lead to clear predictions based on the hypotheses, replication, controls when necessary. You are encouraged to describe more than one experiment or procedure that provide complementary information on a question, such as related gene or protein expression assays, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. If what you propose is previously untried, hedge against potential technical obstacles by suggesting alternative methods. (For example, if no one's ever done CRISPR in unicorns before, maybe RNAi can also work as a loss-of-function method?)

You will be evaluated based on the quality of the question you seek to answer and on the quality of the experimental design. You will not be graded on typical aspects of writing, such as grammar, style, etc. (as long as I can understand your meaning!)  Your plan does not need to be long. It may be written a bulleted list, flow-chart, etc. 

Your plan should not exceed one page. 


Please complete this assignment individually. Although you are welcome to discuss it with others. 

This assignment is worth 50 points toward the final course grade. 

Please submit your assignment on Moodle in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [PDF](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html) format by Sunday, November 12 at 10:00pm.



## Rubric

#### Question

- A  scientific research question relevant to Development Biology that lends itself to specific hypotheses.

Score: `X`/10

#### Hypotheses

- Specific hypotheses related to biological mechanisms.

Score: `X`/10

#### Experimental design

- The experimental system is clearly stated (e.g. zebrafish embryos, mice kidney cell lines, human cerebral organoids).
- Experimental methods are named and are appropriate to the question and the system.
- The needs for replication and controls are addressed.
- It is clear what data will be collected. (What phenotypes will be scored or measurements taken?)

Score: `X`/25

#### Interpretation

- It is clear how results will be interpreted to evaluate hypotheses and reach conclusions regarding the initial question.

Score: `X`/5



**Total Score: `X`/50**
