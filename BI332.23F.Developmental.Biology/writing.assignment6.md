# BI332 Writing Assignment 6

This writing assignment is not related to your final project! Instead it gives you a chance to write a short piece dealing with some topic in developmental biology. Since we will not have a final exam in this course, this assignment gives you a chance to write your own exam question. Just one question. 

## Instructions

Write a prompt for a question on some concept in developmental biology. The topic for this assignment should be different from the topic for your final project. Your question should ask a student to address some fundamental concept in developmental biology, rather than simply to recall a specific term or fact. Your prompt should not be longer than 200 words.

Your submission for this assignment must include:

- Your name. 
- No more than 200 words asking a question relevant to a concept in developmental biology. 
- Include a **short** answer, key or rubric for your question of no more than 200 words.


Please complete this assignment individually. You are welcome to discuss it with others. 

This assignment is worth 30 points toward the final course grade.
