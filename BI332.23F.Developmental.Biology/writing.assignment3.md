# BI332 Writing Assignment 3

Writing assignments this semester will build towards the production of an experimental proposal of your own design in the style of an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) proposal. Our third writing assignment will require you to review background on a topic suitable for the GRFP. 

## Instructions

As introduced in class on October 18, your goal is to review a topic for your final research proposal. 

First, decide on a topic relevant to developmental biology. You can look for ideas from the course schedule, or the table of contents in your textbook. I encourage you to use the topic from your annotated bibliography (Writing Assignment 2), but you are free to change topics if you wish. Regardless, it will likely be necessary to add some references to list for this assignment.

Your submission for this assignment must include 

- Your name. 
- A [working title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) or short sentence stating the question, issue, or phenomenon you are interested in exploring
- 700 to 1000 words reviewing background on your topic. Some review of methods may be included, but the focus should be a biological subject, not a method or technique. Use may use large language models (e.g. ChatGPT), but do so responsibly in accordance with the recommendations from our workshop in October 18-20. 
- Citations to at least 10 articles (from peer-reviewed journals indexed by [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)). Citations should be in the style of a biological journal -- There's lot of variation in those formats, and I will not be dogmatic about style. However, it should contain the authors' surnames and initials in the correct order, year of publication, journal name, volume and page numbers (if the journal uses those), and ideally a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) or [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (internet address). For example, you could use the format of the journal *[Development](https://dev.biologists.org/content/manuscript-prep#3.3.)*.
- Your document must adhere to the [formatting requirements](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23605/nsf23605.htm#prep) of the GFRP. Submissions that do not conform will be returned without a grade.
  - Times New Roman font
  - Font size 11 to 12 point
  - Single line spacing
  - 1-inch margins on all sides
  - Standard letter paper size
  - Cannot exceed 2 pages
  - File size under 10 Mb


Please complete this assignment individually. You are welcome to discuss it with others. 

This assignment is worth 50 points toward the final course grade. 

Please submit your assignment on Moodle in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [PDF](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html) format by Friday, October 27 at 10:00pm.
