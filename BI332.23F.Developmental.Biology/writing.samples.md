## Revise to make a sentence less awkward

> I made this sentence up, but it's based on a real one I found myself writing in an email to the Colby Provost's office.

The bipotential gonad, which can develop as either testes or ovaries and will produce hormones that determine secondary sex differentiation throughout the body, is initially specified by expression of genes including *Lhx9* and *Gata4* (Birk et al. 2000).



## Revise for logical flow

The presence of biologically different sexes is ubiquitous in nature. In fact, most plants and animals show a variety of sexes and somatic, as well as germline, sexual dimorphisms. In sexually dimorphic species, the presence of different sexes is crucial to the reproduction of individuals within that species. Sexual reproduction is thought to be beneficial to organisms because the mixing of genotypes, as well as recombination events, may increase genetic variation and thus adaptability to the environment. However, the presence of a sex phenotype in an individual must be developmentally controlled for. A certain sex characteristic must be genetically or environmentally determined, developed, and maintained by the organism. This determination and development of a specific sexual phenotype is part of the fundamental developmental processes of all sexually dimorphic organisms. Thereby, the study of sex determination becomes an integral part of the study of organismal development and evolution.



## Proofreading

> This text is the abstract from a student's final experimental report in BI279 Genetics from several years ago.

The development of the organs of complex organisms relies heavily on intercellular signals, which tell cells when to grow, divide, or die and what type of cell to become. Signaling pathways, consisting of complex systems of proteins, are an essential part of transmitting these signals and influencing gene expression. One such pathway, known as the Decapentaplegic pathway, is particularly important in the development of *Drosophila melanogaster* and influences wing development, including vein and intervein cell differentiation and cell proliferation in the central regions of the wing disk. Two proteins that are essential to the effectiveness of this pathway are Punt and Thickveins, together forming the cell membrane receptor that allows dpp into the cell, which later effects the expression of various genes. By manipulating the expression of *tkv.ca*, which constitutively activates this pathway, and *putRNAi*, which inactivates this pathway, in expression patterns controlled by the drivers spalt major and apterous, we were able to investigate the effects of activating and inactivating this pathway on wing development. Through this misexpression experiment, we found that *tkv.ca* transgenic flies showed more extreme phenotypes than *putRNAi* transgenic flies, which we concluded provided evidence that upregulation of the Dpp pathway had more of an effect on development than downregulation. We also found that *salm* transgenic flies showed more extreme phenotypic changes than *ap* for both responders and concluded that this is likely due to *salm*’s stronger, more widespread expression throughout the wing.



##Revise for concision

> This is a paragraph from an admittedly long-winded monograph I wrote on the evolution and development of insect mouthparts ([Angelini & Smith 2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29654-4_5))

Ancestrally, insects have a more-or-less direct development of the body plan. While adult structures such as wings and genitalia only appear after the adult molt (or in the subimago of Ephemeroptera; Edmunds and McCafferty 1988), among members of the hemimetabolous orders, which lack a complete metamorphosis, juveniles hatch with appendages similar in structure to those of the adult, differing only in relative size and cuticle or sensory features. Nevertheless, the number of segments in some distal appendage structures can vary by developmental stage. For example, in Oncopeltus juveniles, the legs have two tarsomeres on each leg, while adults have three, apparently due to the formation of a novel joint within the distitarsus. In the Holometabola, species undergo a complete metamorphosis with a non-motile pupa. During this stage, appendages undergo a more dramatic repatterning. In most holometabolous orders, legs and mouthparts are present in juveniles but have a less complex morphology compared to adults. For example, the distal segments of Tribolium juvenile legs are much smaller than in the adult, and the tibiotarsus exists as a single segment that will become two in the adult (Angelini et al. 2012b). Adult structures are produced by cells from corresponding larval structures (Švácha 1992). An extreme “indirect” form appendage development exists in some Holometabola. Drosophila is a familiar example, in which larval appendages are visible externally only as small sensory Keilin’s organs (Dambly-Chaudière and Ghysen 1986). In fruit flies and other Muscomorpha, most of the larval epidermis is polyploid (Smith and Orr-Weaver 1991) and must be replaced during metamorphosis. Imaginal discs give rise to the appendages and much of the surrounding body wall, while imaginal histoblasts produce to the remainder of the adult cuticle (Mandaravally Madhavan and Schneiderman 1977).



## Draft based on an outline

> This was part of an outline I wrote for the introduction of a paper on eye gene expression in cave amphipods ([Asparis et al. 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02481.x)).

**Genetics of eye development**

- Genes of eye development are conserved across animals (Dong & Freidrich, 2010; Halder *et al.*, 1995; Gehring, 1996; Jensen & Wallace, 1997; Neumann & Nüsslein-Volhard, 2000; Quiring *et al.*, 1997) 
- Therefore vertebrates and inverts may evolve changes in eyes with similar genetic changes. 
- Eye devolopement in fruit flies (reviewed by Pappu & Mardon, 2004). 
- Starts late in embryogenesis with expression of the *Pax6* / *eyeless* (*ey*), *twin-of-eyeless* (*toy*), *eyegone* (*eyg*) and *twin-of-eyegone* (*toe*) in the eye-antenna imaginal disc (Czerny *et al.*, 1999; Jang *et al.*, 2003; Jun *et al.*, 1998; Quiring *et al.*, 1994; Yao *et al.*, 2008). 
- Early in the second larval instar, *ey* expression is limited to posterior of eye-antenna disc, specifying the eye primordium. 
- Mutations in these genes lead to loss of eyes (Czerny *et al.*, 1999; Halder *et al.*, 1995; Jang *et al.*, 2003; Quiring *et al.*, 1994), 
- Ectopic expression leads to ectopic eye formation (Czerny *et al.*, 1999; Gehring, 1996)
- Later in the second larval instar, *eyes absent* (*eya*), *sine oculis* (*so*), and *dachshund* (*dac*) expression are required in the eye primordium (Chen *et al.*, 1997; Pignoni *et al.*, 1997; Curtis & Mlodzik, 2000). 
- During pupation the morphogenetic furrow proceeds across the disc in a “wave” of retinal differentiation. 
- Hedgehog protein is secreted from differentiating cells. This moves from one side to other. That’s the “wave” of the furrow. Hedgehog induces new cells to initiate retinal differentiation (Curtis & Mlodzik, 2000; Dominguez & Hafen, 1997; Greenwood & Struhl, 1999; Pappu *et al.*, 2003; Royet & Finkelstein, 1997; Treisman & Rubin, 1995). 
- In zebrafish, *shh* does the same in retinal differentiation! (Neumann & Nüsslein-Volhard, 2000), also in chicks (Zhang & Yang, 2001) and mice (Jensen & Wallace, 1997). The process is super conserved.
