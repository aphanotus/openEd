# BI332 Writing Assignment 5

Writing assignments this semester will build towards the production of an experimental proposal of your own design in the style of an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) proposal. Our fifth writing assignment draws on the skills and project components you've developed so far this year to create a draft proposal.

## Instructions

Your submission for this assignment must include 

- Your name and project title in the header of the document. (Or the first line, if your software cannot allow a page header.) 
- The main text of your proposal must adhere to the [formatting requirements](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23605/nsf23605.htm#prep) of the GRFP. Submissions that do not conform will be returned without a grade.
  - Times New Roman font
  - Font size 11 to 12 point
  - Single line spacing
  - 1-inch margins on all sides
  - Standard letter paper size
  - Cannot exceed 2 pages
  - File size under 10 Mb
- An unlimited number of pages for citations. Citations to at least 10 articles (from peer-reviewed journals indexed by [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)). Citations should be in the style of a biological journal -- There's lot of variation in those formats, and I will not be dogmatic about style. However, it should contain the authors' surnames and initials in the correct order, year of publication, journal name, volume and page numbers (if the journal uses those), and ideally a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) or [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (internet address). For example, you could use the format of the journal *[Development](https://dev.biologists.org/content/manuscript-prep#3.3.)*.

A successful proposal will explain why and how the research plan will address a fundamental question or problem relevant to developmental biology. It must also address NSF's two merit review criteria: **intellectual merit** (the potential to advance knowledge) and **broader impacts** (the potential to benefit society). Your proposal should include sections explicitly addressing each of these merit review criteria. You may use large language models (e.g. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)) as tools in your writing, but do so responsibly following the recommendations from our workshop in October 18-20. 

The rubric below includes components from our past writing assignments as well as the review considerations from NSF's GRFP review panels. This will be the same rubric used to score your final project; only the point values will change. 

This assignment is meant to be a draft. You will receive feedback and have the opportunity for revision before submitting the final project. However, it is expected that this assignment will receive your earnest effort to produce a successful proposal. 


Please complete this assignment individually. Although you are welcome to discuss it with others. 

This assignment is worth 40 points toward the final course grade. 

Please submit your assignment on Moodle in [docx](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/) format (MS Word) or as a link to a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/) by **Saturday, December 2 at 10:00pm**.



## Rubric

#### Question

- A  scientific research question relevant to Development Biology that lends itself to specific hypotheses.
- Explores a creative, original, or potentially transformative concept?

Score: `X`/4

#### Hypotheses

- Specific hypotheses related to biological mechanisms.

Score: `X`/4

#### Coverage of Background Information

- Provides sufficient information for a typical biologist to understand the context of the subject.

Score: `X`/4

#### Integration of the Literature

- Discusses the connections, commonalities or differences among multiple sources to provide a coherent picture of the state of the field.
- Offers critical analysis of the literature, highlighting some strengths and weaknesses where necessary.

Score: `X`/4

#### Significance (Intellectual Merit)

- Points out an unresolved question or gap in our understanding of the topic to explain the potential significance of research in this area.

Score: `X`/4

#### Significance (Broader Impact)

- Explains how research in this area benefits society. 

Score: `X`/4

#### Experimental design

- The experimental system is clearly stated (e.g. zebrafish embryos, mice kidney cell lines, human cerebral organoids).
- Experimental methods are named and are appropriate to the question and the system.
- The needs for replication and controls are addressed.
- It is clear what data will be collected. (What phenotypes will be scored or measurements taken?)

Score: `X`/4

#### Interpretation

- It is clear how results will be interpreted to evaluate hypotheses and reach conclusions regarding the initial question.

Score: `X`/4

#### Clarity and Organization

- Ideas are organized and clearly described.
- Use of standard scientific English and correct terminology.

Score: `X`/4

#### Sources

- At least 10 sources are listed
- Sources are relevant to the research topic
- Sources are from reputable scientific journals or edited volumes that have been peer-reviewed
- Citation formats are acceptable for biology

Score: `X`/4



**Total Score: `X`/40**
