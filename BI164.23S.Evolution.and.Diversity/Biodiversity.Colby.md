This activity allows members of the [Colby College](https://www.colby.edu/) community to explore and share local biodiversity. 

For Spring 2023 students in [BI164C](https://github.com/aphanotus/openEd/blob/main/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity.syllabus.md), this project is also an opportunity to earn extra credit.

## BI164 BioBlitz

An important goal of *[BI164 Evolution and Diversity](https://github.com/aphanotus/openEd/blob/main/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity.syllabus.md)* is to appreciate to amazing range of living things.

### Rules

- Remember, this is meant to be fun! (and educational)
- Observations must be submitted to iNaturalist between March 6 and May 9, 2023.
- Students must submit their own observations 
- Students must provide a reasonable identification of each organism at the time it is submitted. However, the observation will count towards the taxon that the iNaturalist community ultimately identifies it as.
- To count towards an award, organisms must be in their natural environment. (Greenhouses, zoos, aquariums, natural history collections, etc. don't count.) 
- Humans and pets cannot be submitted as observations.
- New awards may be added at any time.
- In the event of a tie, winners will split the point value, rounded up.
- Runners-up will receive the award value -1 point.
- The total for bonus points from this project will be capped at 25 points per student.
- Dr. Angelini has ultimate discretion to determine all outcomes of this competition, including judgements of "cuteness" and "danger".

### Tips

- This activity is optional. If you are not able to participate, it is not required and will not negatively affect your performance in the course.
- You don't need to venture far away! Plenty of organisms live right beside us if you just look up or down, and slow down to be observant. 
- It's always a good idea to go in a group when venturing into natural areas. If you are unfamiliar with outdoor activities please seek the advice of more experienced people.
- This activity is meant to be fun and friendly. So please cheer on your classmates!
- If you collect organisms that are microscopic, talk with Dr. Angelini or your lab instructor able using a microscope to take pictures. Please realize that this might not always be possible due to timing or logistic constraints.
- The list above is really long! It's not expected that you make observations of all of those taxa. This activity is not meant to take up all your time.
