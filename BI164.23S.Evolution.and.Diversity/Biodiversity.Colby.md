This activity allows members of the [Colby College](https://www.colby.edu/) community to explore and share local biodiversity. 

For Spring 2023 students in [BI164C](https://github.com/aphanotus/openEd/blob/main/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity.syllabus.md), this project is also an opportunity to earn extra credit.

## How to get involved?

1. **Create an account with [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)**. It's free and your participation as a citizen scientist will benefit environmental research! Download the app to your smart device or create an account at https://www.inaturalist.org/ 
2. **Join [Biodiversity Colby](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-colby)**. Search for the project "Biodiversity Colby" or follow this link to our [iNaturalist project page](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-colby). Then just click the "Join" button in the upper right.
3. **Upload pictures of living things**. Use your cell phone's camera or any other digital camera. You can upload "Observations" from within the iNaturalist app, either in real time or from your photo reel. Digital camera photos can be transferred to a computer and uploaded on the iNaturalist website. Once you've joined the Project, all your qualifying observations will automatically be added to [Biodiversity Colby](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-colby).

All members of the Colby College Community are welcome to participate!

## BI164 BioBlitz

An important goal of *[BI164 Evolution and Diversity](https://github.com/aphanotus/openEd/blob/main/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity/BI164.23S.Evolution.and.Diversity.syllabus.md)* is to appreciate the amazing range of living things. Towards that end, extra credit (bonus points) will be awarded to students involved in this project, with special bonuses for project leaders.

### Rules

- Remember, this is meant to be fun! (and educational)
- Observations must be submitted to iNaturalist between March 8 and May 9, 2023.
- Students must submit their own observations 
- Students must provide a reasonable identification of each organism at the time it is submitted. However, the observation will count towards the taxon that the iNaturalist community ultimately identifies it as.
- To count towards an award, organisms must be in their natural environment. (Greenhouses, zoos, aquariums, natural history collections, etc. don't count.) 
- Humans and pets cannot be submitted as observations.
- New awards may be added at any time!
- In the event of a tie, winners will split the point value, rounded up.
- Runners-up will receive the award value -1 point.
- The total for bonus points from this project will be capped at 20 points per student.
- Dr. Angelini has ultimate discretion to determine all outcomes of this competition, including judgements of "cuteness" and "danger".

### Tips

- This activity is optional. If you are not able to participate, it is not required and will not negatively affect your performance in the course.
- You don't need to venture far away! Plenty of organisms live right beside us if you just look up or down, and slow down to be observant. 
- It's always a good idea to go in a group when venturing into natural areas. If you are unfamiliar with outdoor activities please seek the advice of more experienced people.
- This activity is meant to be fun and friendly. So please cheer on your classmates!
- If you collect organisms that are microscopic, talk with Dr. Angelini or your lab instructor about using a microscope to take pictures. Please realize that this might not always be possible due to timing or logistical constraints.
- The list of taxa above is really long! It's not expected that you should make observations of every one! This activity is not meant to take up all of your time!
