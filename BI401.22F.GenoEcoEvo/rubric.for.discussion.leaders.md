### How to prepare to lead discussion

**First, read the paper.** You should do this well before the date of your discussion. I suggest giving yourself at least a week, longer if you have other commitments during that time. There *will* be parts of the paper you do not understand; terms or methods you are unfamiliar with. You should **look up what you don't understand**. Use Google to search for terms, or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or [SCOPUS](https://colby.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.scopus.com/) to search for background literature. You're goal is to fully understand the goals, methods, and interpretation of the study. If you are still confused by or uncertain about any part of the paper, **meet with Dr. Angelini** to clarify things. 

Next, **prepare an effective presentation** of background information, key methods and experimental design, and any important critiques of the study. You may use any A/V tools, such as PowerPoint or [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/). You can also simply prepare notes and use the white board. Videos are optional, but be aware that you should keep your presentation under 10 minutes. On the Wednesday of your presentation week, other students will share their Literature Discussion Worksheets. Be sure to **clarify common questions raised in the worksheets**. You can do this in your presentation, for simple technical questions. Finally, you should **devise questions to guide the conversation** in advance. Include a mix of easy questions to get discussion going and deeper ones that require reflection. Some questions raised in the worksheets may be best addressed in group discussion. You can also ask students to reiterate an insightful points they wrote in their worksheets.
